###     AndroHPC  ###
This repository houses code for an all-in-one project integrating all the native frameworks available on Android. This repository is still being cleaned up and refactored, so please check back again after a few weeks for a complete high performance development environment for Android! 
The code for different segments is spread out over different branches. I am cleaning up the repository so that it can be easier to access all the different integrations in one place.
